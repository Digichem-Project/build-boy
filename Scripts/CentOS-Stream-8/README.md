CentOS Stream 8
---------------

The more modern version of CentOS 8, after development was pulled for old-school CentOS 8 (now CentOS Linux 8).
CentOS Stream doesn't seem to use minor version numbers anymore, and in theory is now upstream of redhat (for
CentOS 8, this last may not actually be true).
