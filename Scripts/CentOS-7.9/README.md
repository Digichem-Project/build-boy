CentOS 7.9
----------

Despite already being an ancient OS; CentOS 7 (and/or Redhat 7) is still by far the most popular OS for computational servers (at least anecdotally).

CentOS 7.9 is the oldest OS we offer builds and support for, but Digichem is (perhaps surprisingly) fully supported on this OS (full functionality). The only module not available is Blender/Beautiful Atoms, as there are no builds of a modern enough blender available for CentOS 7.9. All rendering must be done with VMD instead.
